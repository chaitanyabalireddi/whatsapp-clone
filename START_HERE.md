# 🚀 START HERE - Complete Step-by-Step Guide

Follow these steps **in order** to get your WhatsApp Clone running on multiple devices.

---

## ✅ STEP 1: Verify Prerequisites (2 minutes)

### Check if you have everything installed:

**1. Check Node.js:**
```bash
node --version
```
✅ Should show: `v16.0.0` or higher  
❌ If not installed: Download from https://nodejs.org

**2. Check npm:**
```bash
npm --version
```
✅ Should show version number  
❌ Usually comes with Node.js

**3. Check MongoDB:**
```bash
mongod --version
```
✅ Should show version number  
❌ If not installed: Download from https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community

**4. Check Git (optional but recommended):**
```bash
git --version
```

---

## ✅ STEP 2: Install Dependencies (3 minutes)

**Open Command Prompt or PowerShell in your project folder:**
```bash
cd c:\Users\ADMIN\Desktop\whatsappclone
```

**Run the automated setup:**
```bash
setup.bat
```

This will:
- ✅ Check your system
- ✅ Install root dependencies
- ✅ Install server dependencies
- ✅ Install client dependencies

**Wait for it to complete** (might take 2-3 minutes)

---

## ✅ STEP 3: Start MongoDB (1 minute)

### Option A: Windows Service (Recommended)
```bash
# Open Services (Win + R, type 'services.msc')
# Find "MongoDB Server"
# Click "Start"
```

### Option B: Command Line
```bash
# Open a NEW Command Prompt window
# Run:
mongod

# Keep this window open!
```

### Verify MongoDB is Running:
```bash
# In another terminal:
mongosh

# If it connects, MongoDB is running! Type 'exit' to quit
```

---

## ✅ STEP 4: Configure for Multiple Devices (2 minutes)

### Find Your Computer's IP Address:
```bash
ipconfig
```

**Look for:** "IPv4 Address" under your WiFi adapter
**Example:** `192.168.1.100` ← **Write this down!**

### Run Network Setup Script:
```bash
setup-network.bat
```

This will:
- ✅ Display your IP address
- ✅ Add firewall rules
- ✅ Show you what needs to be updated

### Update Configuration Files:

**1. Open:** `server\.env`
```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/whatsapp-clone
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_change_this_in_production_12345
NODE_ENV=development

# CHANGE THIS LINE - Replace with YOUR IP:
CLIENT_URL=http://192.168.1.100:3000
```

**2. Open:** `client\.env`
```env
# CHANGE THESE LINES - Replace with YOUR IP:
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://192.168.1.100:5000/api
REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=http://192.168.1.100:5000
```

**Replace `192.168.1.100` with YOUR actual IP address!**

---

## ✅ STEP 5: Test Network Configuration (30 seconds)

```bash
npm run test-network
```

**You should see:**
- ✓ Local IP Address detected

---

## ✅ STEP 6: Start the Application (1 minute)

**Open a NEW Command Prompt window:**
```bash
cd c:\Users\ADMIN\Desktop\whatsappclone
npm run dev
```

**Wait for these messages:**
```

MongoDB Connected: ...
webpack compiled successfully
```

**Keep this window open!** The app is now running.

---

## ✅ STEP 7: Verify Servers are Running (30 seconds)

**Open a NEW Command Prompt:**
```bash
# Test backend
curl http://localhost:5000

# Should return: {"message":"WhatsApp Clone API is running"}
```

**Or open browser:**
- Go to: `http://localhost:5000`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Can't access from Device 2

**Solution 1: Check WiFi**
```bash
# Both devices MUST be on the same WiFi network
# Check WiFi name on both devices
```

**Solution 2: Check Firewall**
```bash
# Make sure you ran: setup-network.bat
# Or manually allow ports 3000 and 5000
```

**Solution 3: Test Connection**
```bash
# On Device 2 browser, try:
http://YOUR_IP:5000

# Should show: {"message":"WhatsApp Clone API is running"}
# If not, firewall is blocking
```

**Solution 4: Check IP Address**
```bash
# IP might have changed
# Run ipconfig again and update .env files
```

### Problem: MongoDB Connection Error

**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure MongoDB is running
# Check with:
mongosh

# If connection error, start MongoDB:
mongod
```

### Problem: Port Already in Use

**Solution:**
```bash
# Find what's using the port
netstat -ano | findstr "3000"
netstat -ano | findstr "5000"

# Kill the process (replace PID with actual number)
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

### Problem: CORS Error

**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure CLIENT_URL in server\.env matches your IP
# Then restart: npm run dev
```

### Problem: Messages Not Appearing

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
# 2. Verify REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL in client\.env
# 3. Restart both servers
# 4. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl + Shift + R)
```
